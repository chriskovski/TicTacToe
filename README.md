# TicTacToe
A classic 1v1 game of Tic Tac Toe, where the players traditionally mark their spots with 'X's and 'O's.

# Description
This was an exercise following the path of "The Odin Project" of becoming a web developer.

Definitely my hardest project to date. I got it working perfectly (for me) in the end, but I remember looking at the blank file not knowing what my first steps would be. The main issue was with Javascript, the HTML and CSS were pretty straight forward. I included object functions, IIFEs, DOM-Manipulation, lots of array works and much more.
The hardest part was to implement the winning conditions, where I wanted to compare two arrays for possible win combos. I was also struggling in the end with all the bugfixes, too. But as I've written before, in the end, it worked just perfect for my standard.

# How to
Press the Start Button to start the game. Player 1 uses X as marker, Player 2 uses O. First to get 3 of his marks in a row (vertically, horizontally and diagonally) wins. You can reset the game at any time, resulting in the beginning position, in which you have to press the Start button again to play the game.
